1. Choosing athlesiure brands 
To choose athlesiure brands, I looked at the largest clothing companies by market cap: 
https://companiesmarketcap.com/clothing/largest-clothing-companies-by-market-cap/ 
and I selected the top 4 that weren't multi-brand retailers (aka, they sold their own product). Finally, for the fifth company, I used the one that inspired this project - Gymshark. 

The five athlesiure brands I ended up choosing were: 
1. Nike 
2. Adidas 
3. Lululemon 
4. Puma 
5. Gymshark
