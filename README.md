# Introduction 
### Inspiration for this project 
I had been looking for non-expensive, womens athlesiure clothes when a friend suggested going to a certain website (let's call it Website A). He told me that all the shorts on Website A were "cheap". I was mildly surprised, as I was certain I had looked on Website A before and the shorts had been expensive. Regardless, as per his recommendation, I visited the site again, and was not surprised that indeed, all the womens shorts were still expensive. Then, out of curiousity, I visited the mens site. To my surprise (and mild outrage), the mens shorts were being sold at a lower value. However, I was only able to obtain this impression by scrolling through many of the products and creating an estimate in my head. I needed numbers and statistics to back up my impression. Hence, this project was born. 

### Challenges faced 
**Collecting data**
Despite collecting an [absurd amount of data](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10625-businesses-collecting-data.html) from their customers and site visitors, e-commerce companies make it nearly impossible for a customer to collect even a fraction of their data back. Here were some of the obstacles I noticed when doing this project.
1. Varying HTML tags: In my experience, e-commerce companies will not use certain html tags like "price" and "product" for you to find their information in their site. They often give these HTML tags strange, complex names. This is probably to protect against bots, but also makes it more challenging to run a generalized search across all clothing sites.  
2. Gender separation: Not only do e-commerce sites separate sections by gender, but they also rarely give the same name to the same type of product. For example, mens shorts might be called "Ultra-sport shorts" whereas womens shorts are called "High-cut shorts". Both of these features make it more difficult to run a direct comparison across the two because one is not certain exactly what should be compared. (This is where natural language processing comes into play!)

### The argument of different products 
A common argument for pricing disparity between gender is that one clothing item may be of higher quality than another. For example, on a certain site, men's shorts are made of cotton and women's shorts are made of polyester, hence it is fair for a site to price men's shorts higher. Or, women's clothing requires a more complicated sort of cut than men's clothes, hence requiring  a higher price. My rebuttal to this argument is: that's not a choice by the consumer. When I am shopping on an e-commerce website, if my only option is a more expensive, cotton short, then I am still being required to pay a higher price for a certain product against my preferences.

1. Choosing athlesiure brands 
To choose athlesiure brands, I looked at the largest clothing companies by market cap: 
https://companiesmarketcap.com/clothing/largest-clothing-companies-by-market-cap/ 
and I selected the top 4 that weren't multi-brand retailers (aka, they sold their own product). Finally, for the fifth company, I used the one that inspired this project - Gymshark. 

The five athlesiure brands I ended up choosing were: 
1. Nike 
2. Adidas 
3. Lululemon 
4. Puma 
5. Gymshark
